							<h2>Meet Myself</h2>
							<p>I am from Bangladesh, a country of six seasons in Asia. I received my UnderGrad degree from BUET. To make myself an expertise of Transportation Engineering, I joined UKy in Fall 17 to pursue my Masters.</p>

							<h2>Pastime</h2>
							<p>I really love to explore different places. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes and posing in front of camera.You may call me narcissist, but I enjoy it </p>

							<h2>Presenting My Research at TRB 2018</h2>
							<p>The research titled 'Head-on crash probability estimation on two-lane undivided highway from vision-based classified trajectory'. It endeavors to to develop a model that estimates head-on crash probability 
                                                          from classified vehicle trajectory. The model formulation considered:drivers' overtaking decision (OD); and time-to-collision (TTC) on two-lane undivided highway. Drivers' overtaking decision was modeled 
                                                          using nonlinear random parameter multivariate binary logistic regression. It considered both traffic and drivers' characteristics (i.e. aggressiveness) variables. In contrast, TTC was determined using
                                                          a new formulation adding vehicles' dynamic acceleration in consideration. Incorporation of overtaking importance factor (OIF) and crash frequency parameter (CFP) enabled the estimation of crash probability combining
                                                          OD and TTC. Background subtraction technique along with Kalman filter was used to obtain vehicle trajectories from real-time video. Variable inputs required for calibrating the OD model were generated by constructing
                                                          adjacency matrices among the vehicles. Exploiting these inputs, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was applied to obtain calibrated parameters of the OD model for different types
                                                          of vehicle. Calibration result showed that subject vehicle speed and the subject-opposing plays an important role in influencing the overtaking decision. Moreover, the study also found that bus has maximum crash probability.</p>

							<h2>On Going Research: Travel Time Reliability</h2>
							<p>Currently, I am involved with some projects on travel time reliability and congestion measure. The focus is to look at the reliability indices of Kentucky Road System as well as estimating minimum sample size
                                                           for speed data to get a decent measure of congestion. </p>
