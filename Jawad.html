							<h2>Assessing Traffic Forecast Accuracy</h2>
							<p>
							The approval for a project (new construction of roads, adding lanes, improving intersection capacity etc.) 
							depends on the impact of the said project. This is a balance between limited resources and unlimited needs.
							The policy makers would need to understand how adding a new lane would serve the network now and about 20 
							years into the future. Travel demand modelers answer this question by forecasting a traffic into a year in 
							the future. This forecast is dependent on various assumptions and statistics, and for this reason perfect 
							prediction is not a requirement. Even so, a reasonable estimation is expected. For example a toll road is 
							built with investments from private party and their investment hinges on their likely return in a certain 
							number of year. If the traffic forecasts are wildly different from the actual traffic, the investors risk 
							the possibility of losing money (Li and Hensher 2010). Therefore it is necessary to assess the accuracy of 
							traffic forecasts and construct an uncertainty envelope. This accuracy assessment is primarily reliant on 
							the availability of data (forecast counts, forecast year, actual traffic in forecasted year etc.).
