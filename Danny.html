							<h2>A Current Project of Mine</h2>
							<p>The project that I'm currently working on will look at bike sharing and how bike sharing would perform in Lexington, Kentucky. The scope for this project includes looking at other cities that already have existing bike sharing programs and creating a demand model based on those cities. The created model will then be applied to Lexington where it will be used to determine where there is the most demand for bike sharing stations. Once the areas with the most demand are known, recommendations about where to place bike stations will be made.<br />
									The following represent inputs/outputs that will be used or attained during this project:<br />
									<br />
									Model data from other cities.<br />
									How many people frequent an area.<br />
									How many bikes are used/needed.<br />
									Determining where to put bike stations.<br />
