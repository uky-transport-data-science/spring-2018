							<h2>PREDICTION OF PROTECTED-PERMISSIVE LEFT-TURN PHASING CRASHES BASED ON CONFLICT ANALYSIS</h2>
							<p>Left-turning maneuvers are considered to be the highest risk movements at
intersections and two-thirds of the crashes associated with left-turns are reported at
signalized intersections. Left-turning vehicles typically encounter conflicts from
opposing through traffic. To separate conflicting movements, transportation agencies
use a protected-only phase at signalized intersections where each movement is
allowed to move alone. However, this could create delays and thus the concept of a
protected-permissive phase has been introduced to balance safety and delays.
However, the permissive part of this phasing scheme retains the safety concerns and
could increase the possibility of conflicts resulting in crashes. This research developed
a model that can predict the number of crashes for protected-permissive left-turn
phasing, based on traffic volumes and calculated conflicts. A total of 103 intersections
with permissive-protected left-turn phasing in Kentucky were simulated and their leftturn
related conflicts were obtained from post processing vehicle trajectories through
the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). Factors that could affect crash
propensity were identified through the Principal Component Analysis in Negative
Binomial Regression. Nomographs were developed from the models which can be
used by traffic engineers in left-turn phasing decisions with enhanced safety
considerations.</p>
