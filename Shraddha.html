							<h2>About Me...</h2>
							<p>I am from India. The place where i belong to is called Kerala, popularly known as 'God's Own Country'! I did my undergraduation in India and came to the US in 2016 for my Master's at University of Kentucky. Currently, I am a PhD student at UK, specializing in Transportation Engineering.<p>

							<h2>My Research</h2>
							<p>Left-turning maneuvers are considered to be the highest risk movements at
intersections and two-thirds of the crashes associated with left-turns are reported at
signalized intersections. Left-turning vehicles typically encounter conflicts from
opposing through traffic. To separate conflicting movements, transportation agencies
use a protected-only phase at signalized intersections where each movement is
allowed to move alone. However, this could create delays and thus the concept of a
protected-permissive phase has been introduced to balance safety and delays.
However, the permissive part of this phasing scheme retains the safety concerns and
could increase the possibility of conflicts resulting in crashes. My research developed
a model that can predict the number of crashes for protected-permissive left-turn
phasing, based on traffic volumes and calculated conflicts from microsimulation.Factors that could affect crash
propensity were identified through the Principal Component Analysis in Negative
Binomial Regression.</p>
