							<h2>A Ridership Model Apporach to Propose New Bike-Share Station Locations in Lexington</h2>
							<p>As a relief to the current automobile centric transportation systems, many cities around the globe currently operate bike sharing system. Currently, almost every large city in the United States has bikeshare. This study quantifies the factors affecting bike share ridership in the US. In particular, the study investigates the effect of demographic and employment characteristics near bike share stations on bike share ridership in three US cities. A statistical analysis will be done to study how station-level bike sharing ridership correlates with a number of factors such as population density; retail job density; bike, walk, and transit commuters; median income; education; presence of bikeways and proximity to a network of other bike sharing stations. The regression model so developed can be used to predict potential levels of ridership and identify station locations that will serve the greatest number of riders.</p>
